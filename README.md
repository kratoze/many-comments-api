# many-comments

Backend API for Many Comments (find the front end here https://github.com/kratoze/many-comments)

A Reddit-ish clone that allows a user to make posts, comment on posts, comment on comments, and upvote/downvote posts and comments.

Uses Express and MongoDB

This project was started so I can become more familiar with Redux, MongoDB and APIs.
